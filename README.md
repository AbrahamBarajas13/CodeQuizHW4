This is a quiz based on html, css, js. There is also a leaderboard to compare to your friends. There is a main menu that can redirect you to see the current highscores, or to just start the quiz. Starting the quiz will prompt a question with answer choices. A window popup will let you know if you were right/wrong. There is a total of five questions with a time limit of 30 seconds. At the end (or when your time runs out), you are able to put your name to save your highscore and compare to other people who have played.
